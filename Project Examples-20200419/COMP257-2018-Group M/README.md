## Data Science Analysis of Strategies in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

We are conducting an analysis on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Our goal is to understand the factors that determine the outcome of a match in CS:GO.

Our data comes from: https://bit.ly/2FehnuN

It is a collection of data taken from demo matches of CS:GO played in September 2018.

## Summary

Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), developed by Valve Corporation is a massively-popular competitive first person shooter online video game wherein teams of 5 play against each other in an attack/defend scenario (terrorists vs. counter-terrorists). CS:GO is designed to have few to no random elements, meaning talented players can leverage their understanding of fundamental mechanics and teamwork in order to defeat the other team over 30 rounds of gameplay, wherein the first to 16 round victories will be the winners of the match.

We will be closely investigating factors such as the item economy, team strategy, and skill of players in order to determine what contributes to a victory on a per round, and ultimately per match basis.

## Our Files

The notebooks titled csgo_notebook_matt.ipynb, etc. are where we conducted our individual work to avoid overlap. 

csgo_final_report.ipynb is the combination of our work and where the analysis is provided.

Our data is decribed in data_column_descriptions.pdf (it was much too long to include in our analysis).

For the map_data.csv file, here is the explanation the Kaggle dataset provided for it: *"The X,Y coordinates are all in in-game coordinates and need to be linearly scaled to be plotted on any official radar maps. See converting to map coordinates and map_data.csv for more information (https://bit.ly/2Pj8Rze)."*

*Note: The names of our files were changed to better demonstrate their purpose. Consequently, it appears as though only one group member has contributed to the files. The commit history should reflect that all individuals have contributed, and the individual notebooks contain (less refined) forms of the analyses conducted in the final report.*
